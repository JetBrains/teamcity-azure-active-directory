# TeamCity Azure Active Directory Integration [![official JetBrains project](http://jb.gg/badges/official.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

TeamCity plugin which supports authentication via Microsoft Azure Active Directory.

Plugin compatible with TeamCity server 8.1+, 9.0+

## Installation

[Download latest plugin version](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/repository/download/TeamCityPluginsByJetBrains_AzureSupport_AzureActiveDirectoryPlugi/lastSuccessful/azure-active-directory.zip) and [install it as ususal](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Installing+Additional+Plugins#InstallingAdditionalPlugins-InstallingTeamCityplugins)

## Configuration

### Configuring Azure Active Directory

[Register](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn132599.aspx#BKMK_Adding) your TeamCity server as an application in your Azure Active Directory.

Set 'SIGN-ON URL' to `{TEAMCITY_URL}/login.html`

Add 'REPLY URL' `{TEAMCITY_URL}/overview.html`

Also please check for 'CLIENT ID', 'OAUTH 2.0 AUTHORIZATION ENDPOINT' in 'App Endpoints' section.

### Configuring TeamCity server

Add 'Microsoft Azure Active Directory' HTTP authentication module to your [authentication configuration](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCDL/Configuring+Authentication+Settings).

Specify valid 'App OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint' and 'Client ID' retrieved from Azure Portal.

Use 'Log in using Azure Active Directory' link available on Login page to login via your Azure Active Directory account.

## How it works?

This authentication scheme works as following:
- it receives UID, email, username of AD user from specified AD
- looks for already added TeamCity user for received UID, if found authenticate this TeamCity user
- if allowed by scheme options tries find TeamCity user by given e-mail
- if user is not found and user creation is allowed, new TeamCity user is created, some user like email are setted for newly created TeamCity user
