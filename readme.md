TeamCity plugin which supports authentication via Microsoft Azure Active Directory.

The plugin is compatible with TeamCity server 8.1+, 9.0+

# Installation

[Download latest plugin version](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/repository/download/TeamCityPluginsByJetBrains_AzureSupport_AzureActiveDirectoryPlugi/lastSuccessful/azure-active-directory.zip) and [install it as usual](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCDL/Installing+Additional+Plugins#InstallingAdditionalPlugins-InstallingTeamCityplugins)

# Configuration

## Configuring Azure Active Directory

[Register](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn132599.aspx#BKMK_Adding) your TeamCity server as an application in your Azure Active Directory.

Set 'SIGN-ON URL' to {TEAMCITY_URL}/login.html

Add 'REPLY URL' {TEAMCITY_URL}/overview.html

Also please check for 'CLIENT ID', 'OAUTH 2.0 AUTHORIZATION ENDPOINT' in 'App Endpoints' section.

## Configuring TeamCity server

Add the 'Microsoft Azure Active Directory' HTTP authentication module to your [authentication configuration](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCDL/Configuring+Authentication+Settings).

Specify valid 'App OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint' and 'Client ID' retrieved from Azure Portal.

Use the 'Log in using Azure Active Directory' link available on the Login page to log in via your Azure Active Directory account.

# How it works?

This authentication scheme works as following:
- receives the UID, email, username of the AD user the from specified AD
- looks for an existing TeamCity user for the received UID; and if found, authenticates this TeamCity user
- if allowed by the scheme options, tries to find a TeamCity user by the given e-mail
- if the user is not found and user creation is allowed, a new TeamCity user is created; the email is set as the username for the newly created TeamCity user
